# Heart-Disease-Prediction
This project implements a Python-based machine learning approach to identify the likelihood of heart disease from patient clinical records. The process involves importing and cleaning the dataset, managing missing values, performing feature scaling, and conducting exploratory data analysis to ensure the data is suitable for model training.

Several supervised classification techniques—including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, and Random Forest—are applied using the Scikit-learn library. Each model is trained and assessed using evaluation metrics such as accuracy score and confusion matrix to analyze and compare their performance.

Visualization tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn are used to explore feature patterns and gain insights into model predictions. Overall, the project showcases an end-to-end machine learning pipeline and demonstrates the practical use of ML techniques in a healthcare-related prediction problem.
